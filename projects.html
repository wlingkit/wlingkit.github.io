						The effects of temperature on the Oxygen Production of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>

					<div class="sub_sub_heading">
						2018
					</div>
					An experiment done to understand how temperature affects the oxygen production of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and in turn, affects the population of salmon in the environment. The experiment was designed after extensive literature research and was carried out with common laboratory procedures. This includes <b>sterile techniques</b> to ensure little to no contamination of our subjects. Ultimately, we found no significant difference.

					</div>
					An experiment done to have a better understand of how the environment affects the behaviour of <i>Hemigrapsus oregonensis</i>. It was a <b>separate treatment</b> experiment that kept extraneous variables and treatment temperatures constant. The findings agreed with the hypothesis that temperature does have an effect on this species, which gave us insight on how it behaves in nature.
