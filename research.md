### The effects of temperature on the Oxygen Production of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (2018)
This was an experimental study that was designed to help us understand how temperature could affect salmon. Studying Chlamy's behaviour with change of temperature gave us insight on how temperature could affect salmon. By measuring the oxygen production, we can understand how Chlamy can affect salmon as a food source and its ecosystem in-terms of chemical balance. Ultimately, we found no significant difference. 

### Correlation between preference of beverage temperatures and genders (2017)
This was an observational study done at the three Starbucks at University of British Columbia (UBC). It was motivated to benefit business plan design to maximize profit. We have found that the hot and cold ratio for both male and female are about 3:1. Ultimately, no significant difference was found in preferebce vetween gender in this study. However, this information can still be used by owners imrpove their busniess plans.

### Influence of temperature on the rate of movemnt of Hemigrapsus oregonensis (2017)
Hemigrapsus oregonens is a small shore crab An experimental study done to understand the effect of temperature on the velocity of Hemigrapsus oregonensis. We have found that as temperature decreases, so will the rate of movement. 

### Global AI Hackathon (2017)
Designed and built a program that uses machine learning to determine wheather a given sentence is a joke. Data was collected and modified for supervised learning with roughly 75:25 ratio. It achieved an 86% accuracy. However, sample size is considered limited and could improved singificantly.

### Genetics of Perchlorate Reduction (2017)
A project decided as a bioinformatics practice. Using tools such as Genbank, BLAST, and ExPASy on a mutatied sequence, I performed epistasis analysis and determined the pathway and the function of a mutated gene.

### Train station timetable and GPS tracking android app (2015)
A project done to understand android development. The app allows users to check the time of arrivial and departure of trains at different stations. It is also supported by a GPS and showing the closest station to the user.
