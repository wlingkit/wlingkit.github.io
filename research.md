### The effects of temperature on the Oxygen Production of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (2018)
This research project was done in a group of four. It was an experimental study that was design to help us understand how temperature could affect salmon. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamy) is a single-cell green alga that serves as an important food source for the salmon species. Studying Chlamy's behaviour with change of temperature gave us insight on how temperature could affect salmon. By measuring the oxygen production, we can understand how Chlamy can affect salmon as a food source and its ecosystem in-terms of chemical balance. Ultimately, we found no significant difference between Chlamy exposed to higher temperature and to lower temperature with a p-value = 0.08. However, this p-value is actually quite small considering our n = 3 sample size. This suggests that a bigger sample size within each treatment group may allow us to obtain a significant difference between the treatments. Future researches with larger sample size have to be done to solidify our suspicion.
