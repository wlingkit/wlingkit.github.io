title: About me
---

My name is Michael Wong. I am a 4th year science student studying at The University of British Columbia. I primary focus on computer science, microbiology, and chemistry. I've always have a passion about developing things that could impact the world in different ways. For this reason, I began looking for ways that can assist me in this goal. Throughout my university study, I find that the combination of health science and programming is very powerful. Utlizing computational power for biological studies is gaining popularity in the world. It can solve problems in a much faster rate than we could before. As a result, this inspired me to learn more about bioinformatics and its possibilities.
