title: About me
---

My name is Michael Wong. I am a 4th year science student studying at The University of British Columbia. I primary focus on computer science, microbiology, and chemistry. I've always have a passion about developing things that could impact the world in different ways. For this reason, I began looking for ways that can assist me into this goal. Throughout my university study, I find that the combination of health science and programming is very powerful. Solving a biological problem with computational theory can increase the speed and accuracy significantly. ----------
