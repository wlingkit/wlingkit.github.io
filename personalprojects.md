### Space invader (2017)
Space invader is a game that most people have played. Being a gamer myself, I decided to learn how to build one myself.
I picked and used Python because it was the language that I was the most comfortable with at the time. I utilized the turtle library for the purpose of setting the stage and objects. The rest are implmentation of different controls and interactions. Interestingly, the implmentation of the controls and interactions were actually the most challenging. This is because there were a lot of edge cases that are not obvious at first glance and require more thinking than coding. Nonetheless, I was able to create a runnable game and learned a lot while doing so.

### Tic tac toe (2017)
This game was made in C++ and its a simple command line game. The main thing I took away from this experience is that a well desgined algorithm can achieve many with minimum amount of work.
